nuke_uwu Plans & Notes


# Plans:
 
#### Things to add to nuke_uwu before “Operation: Fuck A Russian”:
 - add “delete all roles” script
 - add “delete all channels” script
 - add “ban all members possible” script
 - test features
 - Combine “fuck a server steps” into one command

 - Test if we need to hard code in exceptions
 - If needed, hard-code in exceptions for the bot (i.e: don’t ban the bot itself, don’t delete the bot’s role, etc.)
 - Test each command for “fun steps”
 - Test if banning/kicking all members kicks the bots also.
 - Once tested + verified that it works, create a command that does ALL the “fun steps” (aka does everything to fuck a server).


#### Future Development Plans:
 - add “features.md”
 - update “README.md”
 -
